Later that winter, he was sent to the Darren Lehmann\\nCricket  Academy  in  Adelaide,  South  Australia,  to  fine  tune  his\\ngame.[25]\\n\\nIn  2011,  Root’s  County  Championship  debut \\nagainst\\nWorcestershire  at  New  Road  in April  was  one  of  15  matches  he\\nplayed  that  year  on  top  of  his  England  Lions  cricket  team  debut\\nagainst  Sri  Lanka  A.  At  Scarborough  in  August,  he  scored  his\\nmaiden  Championship  hundred  against  Sussex.

He was also included in the ODI squad after Jonny Bairstow withdrew.[30] Root was not required\\nto bat on his ODI debut either, but did bowl nine overs, collecting figures of 0-51, as England won by\\nnine runs. He made scores of 36 and 39 in the next two matches, before making his maiden ODI fifty in\\nthe fourth match of the series, although England lost by five wickets. Root finished the series with 163\\nruns.\\n\\nFollowing the successful tour of India, Root was retained in the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand\\nand was added to the previously announced ODI and T20 squads. After being an unused batsman in the\\nthird T20, he started the ODI series with two half-centuries, contributing 56 in the first game before top-\\n\\n\\x0cscoring with 79 off 56 balls in the second. In doing so, Root became the first batsman to start his ODI\\ncareer with six consecutive scores of over 30 and finished the series with 163 runs.[31]\\n\\nIn the Test series, Root continued to bat in the middle-order and in the third Test he made 45 of 176 balls\\nbefore being bowled by Tim Southee. The series ended 0-0 and Root finished the series with 88 runs.\\n\\n2013–14: New Zealand, Champions Trophy and back-to-back Ashes series\\n\\nNew  Zealand  travelled  to  England  in  the  summer  of  2013  and\\nRoot’s first involvement was to captain the England Lions against\\nthe Black Caps in a four-day warm-up match, where he scored 179\\nruns. After scoring 40 and 71 runs in the first Test at Lord’s, Root\\nscored his maiden Test century at his home ground of Headingley,\\nhitting  104  runs  off  167  balls  and  became  the  first  Yorkshire\\nplayer  to  score  their  first  Test  century  at  Headingley.[32]  He\\nfinished  the  series  as  England’s  top  scorer  with  243  runs  and\\nhelped  his  side  to  a  2–0  series  victory.  In  the  ODI  series  that\\nfollowed, Root made scores of 30, 28 and 33 as England lost the\\nseries 2–1.[33]\\n\\nRoot was named in the England squad for the Champions Trophy.\\nHe  featured  against  Sri  Lanka  and  hit  68  runs  off  55  balls  in  a\\nseven-wicket  loss.[34]  Root  helped  England  to  a  10-run  win  over\\nNew Zealand by making 38 runs off 40 balls, which secured them\\na place in the semi-finals.[35] In the last four against South Africa,\\nRoot  scored  48  off  71  balls  as  England  eased  to  a  seven-wicket  win  and  advanced  to  the  final.[36]\\nFollowing  England’s  loss  to  India,  he  was  named  as  12th  man  in  the  Team  of  the  Tournament  by  the\\nICC.[37]\\n\\nRoot in 2013\\n\\nRoot was asked to opening the batting with captain Alastair Cook for the Ashes after the selectors decided\\nto drop Nick Compton from the England side. In the first Test he made scores of 30 and 5, and took his\\nfirst Test wicket when he had Ed Cowan caught in the second innings.[38] In the second innings of the\\nsecond Test, Root made 180 before England declared to set Australia a target of 583. In the final innings\\nRoot took the wickets of Usman Khawaja and Australia captain Michael Clarke in consecutive overs with\\nboth batters well set on 50-plus scorers. This saw Root named Man of the Match for his performance with\\nbat  and  ball.[39]  England  retained  the Ashes  after  a  drawn  third  Test  and  victory  in  the  fourth  saw  the\\nseries won, though Root did not contribute significantly to either result. He top-scored for England in the\\nfinal Test to finish the series with 339 runs.\\n\\nRoot  was  selected  to  bat  at  number  four  for  the  first  T20I,  with Australia  setting  England  249  to  win.\\nRoot  came  in  with  England  37-3  and  scored  a  career-best  90  not  out  from  49  balls,  but  this  was  not\\nenough to prevent a 39-run defeat. Root also played in the second game, which England won, to split the\\nseries.[40] England lost the ODI series 2–1, with Root finishing the series with 36 runs from four matches.\\n\\nRoot was selected for the return Ashes in Australia. He was moved back to number six for the first Test\\nwith Michael Carberry given the opening batsman role alongside Alastair Cook. Root only managed two\\nruns  from  seven  balls  in  the  first  innings  before  being  caught  off  a  Mitchell  Johnson  delivery.  In  the\\nsecond innings Root made 26 not out off 86 balls before running out of partners as England collapsed to\\n\\n\\x0cdefeat.[41]  The  second  Test  saw  Root  move  up  to  number\\nthree,  filling  the  spot  vacated  by  Jonathan  Trott,  who  had\\nreturned home due to a stress related illness.[42] He scored\\nonly  15  runs,  which  was  the  third  highest  number  of  runs\\nscored  by  an  England  batsman  in  the  first  innings,  in  a\\ncollapse  by  England.[43]  However,  Root’s  second  innings\\nshowed  some  fight  as  he  top  scored  with  87  and  was\\nunfortunate not to make a century. England went on to lose\\nand  trailed  2–0.[44]  Root  was  out  controversially  for  just\\nfour in the first innings of the third Test and made 19 in the\\nsecond  as  England  lost  the  match  and  as  a  result\\nrelinquished the Ashes.[45] When England lost the fourth Test, Root was dropped for the final Test, with\\nYorkshire  teammate  Gary  Ballance  making  his  Test  debut.  England  went  on  to  lost  the  series  5-0  and\\nRoot finished the series with 192 runs.[46]\\n\\nRoot in training in Australia\\n\\nRoot  batted  at  three  in  the  first  ODI,  however,  he  only  made  three  runs  before  getting  out  LBW.  He\\nmanaged to take the wicket of David Warner as Australia cruised to a six-wicket victory. England kept\\nfaith  despite  Root’s  waning  form  and  he  played  in  the  second  ODI,  but  only  made  two  runs  before\\nMitchell Johnson trapped him in front. Root did contribute with the ball by taking the wickets of Shaun\\nMarsh and Michael Clarke. Root was dropped for third and fourth ODIs due to his poor run of scoring,\\nbut returned for the final match, adding 55 from 86 balls. Root finished the series part of a side that lost\\n4–1, making 60 runs.\\n\\nRoot  was  named  in  the  T20  side  and  in  the  first  match  made  32  off  24  before  being  caught  by Aaron\\nFinch. In the second T20 he made 18 runs in another loss, England finishing the series 3-0 losers.

In the second Test of the series, Root\\nmade 66 in England\\'s second innings but was unable to prevent a\\ndefeat. In the third match of the series, Root made a quick fire 66\\nin England\\'s second innings to help them force a result and level\\nthe series at 1–1. He hit yet another half century in the fourth Test,\\nas England won by an innings to take a 2–1 series lead. In the final\\nTest  at  the  Oval,  Root  scored  his  5th  Test  century  scoring  an\\nunbeaten 149 to help England post a first innings score of 486 all\\nout in reply to India\\'s 148 all out. Root won the Man of the Match\\naward  for  his  performance  in  that  Test.  This  resulted  in  England\\nwinning the match by an innings and secured a 3–1 series win. He\\nfinished  the  Test  series  with  518  runs  and  1  wicket.  For  his\\n\\nJoe Root batting against Sri Lanka\\nat Lords, June 2014\\n\\nperformances in 2014, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.[50]\\n\\nRoot had an indifferent time in the ODI series, after the first match was abandoned he made scores of 4\\nand  2  in  the  second  and  third  ODI\\'s.  However,  he  made  44  in  the  fourth  game  before  hitting  a  match\\nwinning  113  in  the  final  game  of  the  series.  The  series  finished  3–1  to  India  and  Root  top  scored  for\\nEngland making 163 runs.\\n\\nNow an integral part of the English set-up, Root was selected in the 2014–15 tour to Sri Lanka to play in\\nthe  7  game  ODI  series.

During  the  second  Test,  Root  scored  88  off  141  balls\\nhowever he threw away the opportunity to convert this into a century. Root also went on to score 71 off\\n171 balls in the second innings and this put him up to No. 1 on the ICC Player Rankings for a second\\ntime  rising  above  Steve  Smith.[56]  This  also  took  Joe  past  3,000  Test  runs.  During  the  third  Test  Root\\nmade scores of 4 and 6 in England\\'s collapse and England succumbed to a 2–0 series loss. Root finished\\nthe series with 287 runs, England\\'s second highest run scorer.\\n\\n\\x0cHaving been reinstated into the ODI squad, Root batted at number 3 in the first ODI however he was out\\nfor 0.

However he was included\\nin the second T20I and came in to bat at number 4 behind James Vince. Root made 20 runs off 16 balls in\\nthe narrow 3 run win. For the third T20, Root was promoted to bat at number 3 with Alex Hales being\\nrested  and  James  Vince  opening.  Joe  scored  32  runs  off  22  balls  to  help  England  to  a  total  of  154/8.\\nPakistan  reached  this  total  and  took  the  match  to  a  Super  Over  which  England  won.  Root  finished  the\\nseries as a 3–0 winner and scored a total of 52 runs.\\n\\nRoot  was  selected  for  the  England  squad  on  the  2015–16  tour  to  South Africa. This  would  be  the  first\\ntime Joe would face South Africa in a Test series. In the first warm up game, against an invitational XI, he\\nscored 26 in the first innings and 37 in the second. In the second warm up game against the South African\\nsecond team, he was much more prolific scoring 117 off 125 balls helping England to a total of 414-6d.\\n\\nIn the first Test of the series, Root made 24 off 37 balls in the first innings before being trapped lbw to\\nDane Piedt.

In the second innings (chasing 73)\\nhe hit the winning runs to ensure England won the series. This marks the first time since 2004–05 that a\\nteam has won a series in South Africa. In the fourth and final Test, Root scored 76 off 128 balls to help\\nEngland to a score of 342 all out in reply to South Africa\\'s 475. He finished the series as a 2–1 winner and\\nwas England\\'s second highest scorer with 386 runs. For his performances in 2015, he was again named in\\nthe World Test XI by the ICC.[57]\\n\\nIn  the  first  ODI,  Root  scored  52  from  58  balls  to  help  back  up  Jos  Buttler\\'s  century  on  the  way  to\\nEngland\\'s  total  of  399  (their  third  highest  ever  One  Day  score).  In  the  second  ODI  he  only  made  38\\nbefore being bowled. Root backed this up with his 7th ODI century scoring 125 in a losing effort in the\\nthird  ODI.  During  the  fourth  ODI,  Root  scored  109,  his  second  consecutive  century,  in  another  losing\\neffort leaving the series drawn 2–2 coming into the fifth ODI.

He featured in the first match\\nagainst the West Indies and scored 48 from 36 balls in a losing effort. In the second match against South\\nAfrica he scored 83 off 44 balls in England\\'s record breaking chase of 230. Root was named man of the\\nmatch for this effort. In England\\'s narrow victory against Afghanistan, Root made 12 runs before being\\nrun out. In the final group match against Sri Lanka he managed to make 25 and take a crucial catch in\\n\\n\\x0cEngland\\'s 10 run win, ensuring their place in the semi-final. England faced New Zealand in the semi-final\\nand were set to chase 154, Root scored 27* from 22 balls to secure a place in the final. In the final against\\nthe  West  Indies,  Root  scored  54  from  37  balls  in  England\\'s  155–9  and  took  the  key  wickets  of  Chris\\nGayle and Johnson Charles. However this wasn\\'t enough to secure a win. Root finished the tournament as\\nthe 3rd highest scorer with 249 runs. Joe Root became only the 3rd player after Shahid Afridi and Marlon\\nSamuels to score a fifty and to take at least a wicket in an ICC World T20 final.[58]\\n\\nRoot was selected in the England squad for the Sri Lankan tour of England. In the second Test, he scored\\n80 to help England to a first innings total of 498/9d and eventually secure a 9 wicket win and with it, a\\nseries win.\\n\\nIn the fourth match of the series, Root scored 65 as England chased down Sri Lanka\\'s target of 306 to win\\nthe match by six wickets.

The third\\nTest at Edgbaston was not as memorable, making just 3 in the first innings but then playing a resilient 62\\nin the second to help England to a total of 445/6 and eventually, a 141 run victory. The final Test was lost\\nby 10 wickets and the series ended in a 2–2 draw. In the ODI series, Root made 61 in the first match as\\nEngland recorded an opening victory. England won the second match, with Root scoring 89. In the third\\nmatch, Root scored 85 as England broke the record for the highest ever ODI score, finishing on 444/3.\\n\\nRoot was rested for the ODI series against Bangladesh, but was included in the Test squad. In the first\\nTest  against  Bangladesh,  Root  made  40  in  the  first  innings  and  followed  this  up  with  just  a  single  in\\nEngland\\'s second innings, although they won by 21 runs. In the second Test, Root made 56 in the first\\ninnings as England built a first innings lead, but was out for just one in the second innings as England lost\\nthe game to draw the series 1–1.\\n\\n2016–2017: India\\n\\nRoot made 124 in England\\'s first innings of the first Test against India as England made 537, though the\\nmatch ended in a draw. For his performances in 2016, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.[60]\\n\\nRoot  made  scores  of  90  not-out  and  101  in  the  second  and  third  ODIs  of  the  away  series  against West\\nIndies in March 2017, with England winning the series 3–0.Twin tons round off [61]\\n\\nRoot was named as part of the \\'Team of the Tournament\\' at the 2017 Champions Trophy by the ICC,[62]\\nafter he finished as the fourth highest run-scorer with England making the semi-final.\\n\\nTest captaincy\\n\\n\\x0cRoot  replaced  Alastair  Cook  as  the  full-time  Test  captain  on  13\\nFebruary  2017  following  the  latter\\'s  resignation,  making  him\\nEngland\\'s  80th  captain.[63]  In  his  first  match  as  the  captain,  on  6\\nJuly  2017,  against  South  Africa  at  Lord\\'s,  Root  scored  his  12th\\nTest century with an innings of 190. He was the 6th (and highest\\nscoring)  England  player  to  score  a  Test  century  on  captaincy\\ndebut.  He  also  had  an  influence  on  county  teammate  Gary\\nBallance\\'s recall to the England squad.[64] England won the match\\nto  set  up  a  3–1  series  victory.  A  Test-series  victory  over  West\\nIndies followed, in the second Test of which Root equalled AB de\\nVilliers\\'  record  of  scoring  a  half-century  in  12  consecutive  Test\\nmatches.[65]\\n\\nRoot (centre) discusses tactics with\\nbowlers Stuart Broad and Jimmy\\nAnderson\\n\\nAshes series: 2017–18\\n\\nRoot captained the English team in 2017–18 Ashes series in an unsuccessful defence of the Ashes, losing\\nfour of the five Tests. In Brisbane England batted first and scored 302 and 195, with Root\\'s scores being\\n15 and 51. In the second Test at Adelaide Root\\'s scored 9 and 67 out of totals of 227 and 233. In Perth,\\nEngland scored 403 and 218, Root\\'s scores 20 and 14, while Australia made 662/9 declared, winning the\\nmatch and the series before tea on the final day. In the final match, he retired at 59 in the second innings\\nafter succumbing to gastroenteritis. He failed to convert any of his five half-centuries into centuries in the\\nseries.[66] His next century did not come until 10 September 2018 against India at The Oval in the second\\ninnings, where Alastair Cook also scored a century on his final Test match.[67]\\n\\n2018: Pakistan & India\\n\\nEngland drew 1–1 at home to Pakistan in a 2 match series.\\n\\nEngland bounced back and beat India 4–1. Root failed to make a score in the first 4 Tests, but scored 125\\nin the last Test. This was his first century of 2018 after going without a century in the last 3 Test series\\n(Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan). This was also Root\\'s last game with former captain Alistair Cook.\\nRoot impressed in the preceding ODI series against India, scoring 217 runs, which included two back-to-\\nback centuries.\\n\\nSri Lanka: 2018\\n\\nRoot  became  the  first  English  captain  to  win  a  Test  series  in  Sri  Lanka  since  2001,  ending  a  run  of  3\\nseries in Sri Lanka without a win.[68][69] He scored 124 in the 2nd Test to secure a series win; his first\\never Test series away win as captain.[70] This was also the first away Test series win England had won\\nsince 2016.[71]\\n\\n2019: Cricket World Cup\\nIn April 2019, he was named in England\\'s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[72][73] He had a good\\nstart  to  the  tournament,  scoring  two  centuries  (against  Pakistan  and  West  Indies)  and  three  fifties  in\\nEngland\\'s first six matches.[74] On 21 June 2019, in the match against Sri Lanka, Root played in his 250th\\ninternational match for England.[75]\\n\\n\\x0cHe  was  named  in  the  \\'Team  of  the  Tournament\\'  for  the  2019  World  Cup  by  the  ICC.  They  stated  that\\n\"England\\'s  run  machine  over  the  years,  Joe  Root  was  the  glue  that  held  their  famed  batting  together\\nthrough the tournament. The Yorkshire batter finished as the fifth highest run-scorer of the tournament,\\nwith 556 runs from 11 innings. Root\\'s flawless technique and ability to keep the scoreboard moving by\\nrotating the strike and finding the boundaries when required makes him a perfect No.3 in this line-up\".[76]\\n\\nAshes series: 2019\\n\\nRoot  captained  England  in  the  2019  Ashes  Series,  as\\nEngland and Australia drew 2–2 with Australia retaining the\\nAshes.  Root\\'s  batting  position  was  widely  discussed  in  the\\nbuild-up to the series, with Root eventually moving up the\\norder to bat at three.[77][78] Root made a half century in the\\nfirst Test as Australia won by 251 runs,[79] while the second\\nTest  at  Lord\\'s  was  drawn,  with  Root  making  14  and  0.[80]\\nSteve Smith, who made twin hundreds in the first Test and\\nwas a thorn in England\\'s side throughout the previous Ashes\\nseries,[81]  missed  the  third  Test  with  a  concussion.[82]\\nEngland  capitalised  by  levelling  the  series  courtesy  of  an\\nincredible  one  wicket  win  at  Headingley,  with  Ben  Stokes\\nmaking 135* in a record fourth innings chase for England,\\nJoe Root scoring 0 and 77.[83][84]\\n\\nRoot and Ben Stokes walk out to bat on the\\npenultimate day of the 3rd Test at\\nHeadingley\\n\\nAustralia retained the Ashes with a 185 run victory at Old Trafford in the fourth Test, helped by a first\\ninnings double hundred from the returning Steve Smith, as Root made scores of 71 and 0.[85][86] England\\nrestored some pride at the Oval with a 135 run victory to conclude the series, which was drawn 2–2.[87]\\nRoot again made a half-century but failed to score a century in the series, leading to further criticism of\\nRoot\\'s conversion rate.[88] Root averaged just 32.50 throughout the series.[89]\\n\\n2019–20: New Zealand & South Africa\\n\\nIn December 2019, in the second Test match against New Zealand, Root scored his first double century as\\ncaptain of England,[90] and became the first visiting captain to score a double century in New Zealand in\\nTest cricket.[91]\\n\\nRoot captained England to a 3–1 series victory in South Africa, which he described as his \\'proudest result\\'\\nas captain.[92][93] England got off to a slow start, losing the first Test at Centurion,[94] but came back to\\nwin the series comfortably.[95] In the third Test he took career best bowling figures of 4-87 as England\\nwon on a turning Port Elizabeth pitch.[96] Root had a consistent series with the bat, making three half-\\ncenturies,[97] but was criticised once more for not converting his fifties into hundreds.[98][99]\\n\\n2020: West Indies & Pakistan\\n\\nIn order to be present for the birth of his second child, Root missed the first Test of the three match series\\nagainst West Indies.[100] England lost the match; Root returned to captain the side to a 2–1 series victory,\\nwith his most significant innings being a score of 68 not out to set up a declaration in the final Test.[101]\\n\\n\\x0cRoot  captained  England  to  a  second  series  win  of  the  summer  with  a  1–0  win  in  the  three  Test  series\\nagainst Pakistan: England won the first Test followed by two rain-affected draws.[102]\\n\\nIn November 2020, Root was nominated for the Sir Garfield Sobers Award for ICC Male Cricketer of the\\nDecade and the award for Test cricketer of the decade.[103][104]\\n\\n2021: Sri Lanka & India\\n\\nRoot led England for the two match Test series against Sri Lanka, which was previously postponed due to\\nthe  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  the  first  Test,  Root  scored  228,  his  18th  Test  century  and  his  first  for  13\\nmonths. For his efforts (which led to England winning by 7 wickets), he was named Man of the Match.\\nRoot\\'s  run  of  form  continued  into  the  second,  where,  by  scoring  186,  he  became  the  first  Englishman\\nsince  David  Gower  to  pass  150  in  consecutive  Tests.  During  the  innings  he  also  overtook  Geoffrey\\nBoycott,  Kevin  Pietersen  and  Gower  to  become  the  fourth-highest  Test  run-scorer  for  England.  On  29\\nJune 2021, in the opening fixture against Sri Lanka, Root played in his 150th ODI match.[105] In the same\\nmatch, Root also scored his 6,000th run in ODI cricket, making him the fourth fastest player (in terms of\\ninnings) to reach 6000 runs.[106][107]\\n\\nLater  in  the  summer,  Root  continued  his  good  form  in  Tests,  with  centuries  in  each  of  the  first  three\\ngames in the series against India seeing him return to the top of the ICC Test batting rankings.[108] As a\\nteam England fared less well, trailing the series 2–1 when the final Test was postponed due to COVID-\\n19.[109]\\n\\n2021–22: Australia and West Indies\\n\\nRoot\\'s good form did not continue into the 2021–22 Ashes series; though he was the leading run-scorer\\nfor England, he only managed three fifties and a top score of 89, as England lost the series 4–0.[110] The\\nresult saw the sacking of Chris Silverwood as head-coach of the England team,[111] and calls for Root to\\nstep  down  as  captain.[112]  However,  he  was  retained  for  the  away  series  against West  Indies,  scoring  a\\nsecond-innings century in the drawn First Test, taking his tally of 100s to 24, and clear second place on\\nthe list England Test centurions.[113]\\n\\nOn 4 January 2022, at the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney, he captained England for the 60th time taking the\\nrecord for the most Test matches as England captain.[114] On 15 April 2022, having captained England 64\\ntimes,  Root  resigned  as  Test  captain  stating:  \"It  has  been  the  most  challenging  decision  I  have  had  to\\nmake in my career but having discussed this with my family and those closest to me; I know the timing is\\nright\".[115][116]\\n\\nPost-captaincy\\n\\n2022–present\\n\\nIn  the  second  innings  of  the  first  Test  match  of  the  2022  series  against  New  Zealand,  he  scored  115*,\\nwhich helped England chase down 277 runs.

In the third\\n\\n\\x0cTest match, he scored 86* in England\\'s second innings to help England chase down 296 runs. Throughout\\nthe series, he scored a total of 396 runs in six innings, at an average of 99, and was awarded the Player of\\nthe Series.[118][119]\\n\\nDuring the rescheduled fifth Test against India, Root scored the winning runs with his unbeaten 142. He\\nfinished the series with over 700 runs in five Tests.[120]\\n\\nOn the third day of the first Test of the series against Pakistan at Multan in October 2024, Root overtook\\nSir Alastair Cook as England\\'s highest Test run-scorer of all time,[121] and move into fifth place on the list\\nof  highest  run-scorers  in  Test  history.  This  was  part  of  his  highest  Test  score  to  date  of  262,  his  sixth\\ndouble-century, and in the same innings he shared an England record stand of 454 with Harry Brook.[122]\\nThis was also a record for any fourth-wicket partnership in Tests.\\n\\nInternational centuries\\n\\nHaving  scored  51  international  centuries,  Root  currently  is\\nthe ninth highest international century maker of all time.[123]\\n\\nAwards\\n\\nICC Men\\'s Test Cricketer of the Year: 2021[124]\\nICC Test Team of the Year: 2014, 2015, 2016,\\n2021, 2023\\nWisden Cricketer of the Year: 2014[125]\\nICC ODI Team of the Year: 2015, 2018[126]\\nEngland Test Cricketer of the Year: 2015[127]\\nEngland Limited-Overs Cricketer of the Year:\\n2015[127]\\nRoot was appointed Member of the Order of the\\nBritish Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year\\nHonours for services to cricket.[128]\\nICC Player of the Month: August (2021)[129]\\nPCA Player of the Year: 2021[130]\\nWisden\\'s Five Cricketers of the Year: April 2022[131]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCenturies against different nations\\n\\nOpponent\\n\\nTest ODI\\n\\nT20I\\n\\n Australia\\n\\n Bangladesh\\n\\n India\\n\\n New Zealand\\n\\n Pakistan\\n\\n South Africa\\n\\n Sri Lanka\\n\\n West Indies\\n\\n4\\n\\n—\\n\\n10\\n\\n5\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n—\\n\\n1\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n35\\n\\n16\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n1. \"England vs West Indies LIVE: Second Test, day four, Trent Bridge – cricket score, radio\\n\\ncommentary, video highlights and text updates\" (https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/live/cx0\\n092z3n9xt).\\n\\n2. \"Joe Root \\'England\\'s best player of all time\\' - Gooch\" (https://au.sports.yahoo.com/joe-root-e\\nnglands-best-player-134800507.html).
